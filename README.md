This is a discord ddos bot that utilises ddos apis to send attacks via commands! The code is extremely messy as I never intended to release it when first writing it - and I would appreciate it if you didn't cry about that.

This bot has its own method renaming (naming a method on the bot "UDP" for example but it sending an attack using "TCP" on your api). It has maxtime and minimum time and channel ids for moderating it.

I take no responsibility how you use this.
